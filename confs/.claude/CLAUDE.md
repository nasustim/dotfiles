# Core Principles

**MUST** If project user is working on has a testing system, you should write tests following the specifications first, then implement the system (test-driven development).
**MUST** Implement features without breaking existing tests or linters' settings.
**MUST** Always verify functionality using tests and linters.
**SHOULD** Before changing code, create a TODO_{task or branch name}.md file and write down your plan for the changes. Keep managing it throughout development.
**SHOULD** Unless I specifies otherwise, you should commit your own changes on my behalf.
