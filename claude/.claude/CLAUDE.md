# Core Principles

- Implement features without breaking existing tests or linters' settings.
- Always verify functionality using tests and linters.
- Before changing code, create a TODO_{task or branch name}.md file and write down your plan for the changes. Keep managing it throughout development.
- If the project has a testing system, you should write tests following the specifications first, then implement the system (test-driven development).
